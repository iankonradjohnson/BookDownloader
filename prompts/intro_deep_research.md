### Research Scope & Methodology

1. **Query Plan** – Execute *at least* 20 targeted search queries covering:

   * Author’s biography and professional milieu
   * Publication history and reception of the original edition
   * Architectural movements, technologies, and social currents contemporaneous with the work
   * Comparable titles or pattern books of the era
   * Influence on later architects, builders, or theorists
   * Gaps this book fills in modern architectural discourse

2. **Source Mix** – Prioritize peer‑reviewed journals, primary documents, reputable archives (e.g., JSTOR, HathiTrust, museum libraries), and recent scholarship (last 10 years) that re‑evaluates the work.

3. **Note‑Taking** – Capture key facts, quotes, and dates with full citations (Chicago author‑date). Distill each source into 1–2‑sentence takeaways focused on relevance to modern readers.

4. **Synthesis Outline** – Organize findings into a brief outline:

   * Historical setting (time, place, prevailing ideas)
   * Unique contributions of the book
   * Reasons the knowledge was lost or overlooked
   * Its value to contemporary practice and Abacus Press’s revival mission

### Writing Guidelines

* **Length**: \~500–700 words.
* **Tone**: Accessible yet authoritative; avoid jargon.
* **Structure**: Hook → historical context → book’s significance → why it matters now → bridge to the reader.
* **Voice**: Third‑person narrative with a short first‑person Abacus Press statement at the close (1–2 sentences).
* **Citations**: Endnotes or parenthetical, per Chicago style.
* **Format**: **Output the final introduction in Markdown**, using clear headings (`#`, `##`), italics/bold where helpful, and bullet lists only when they genuinely aid readability.
